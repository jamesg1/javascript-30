    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = "example";
    console.log(team4);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'James G',
      age: 80
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
